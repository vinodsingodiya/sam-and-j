           <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Sam & J was founded with a belief that luxury should be sustainable and reasonably priced at the same time. We encourage our clients to go for lab grown diamonds, and ethically-sourced natural precious stones such as sapphires and aquamarines over mined diamonds.</p>
       <p>Lab grown diamonds are identical to mined diamonds in every way, except that they are sustainably grown aboveground. Because of their origin, Sam & J’s diamonds are much kinder to our planet Earth as they avoid social and environment impacts associated with diamond mining. It is not possible to be 100% certain that ‘blood diamonds’ do not find their way to the supply chain of mined diamonds. Hence by going for lab grown diamonds, we can make the world a more ethical and sustainable place.</p>
