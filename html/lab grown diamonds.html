        <h1>WHAT ARE LAB GROWN DIAMONDS</h1>
        <p>As its name suggests, lab grown diamonds are grown and produced in a laboratory, which recreates the
            conditions of the natural diamond growing process. They are REAL diamonds, NOT diamond simulants. Because
            the growth process is similar, lab grown diamonds also vary in Cut, Colour and Clarity – without the social
            and environmental impacts caused by mining diamonds.</p>
        <p>“They are real diamonds. They have the same optical, chemical, thermal, and physical features.” – Matthew
            Hall, Director, Gemological Institute of America (GIA)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="w1">
        <h1>Lab grown diamonds vs mined <br> diamonds</h1>
        <p>Lab grown diamonds share identical chemical, optical and physical composition as mined diamonds. The only
            difference is their origin. It is difficult to distinguish a blood diamond – a product of child labour
            exploitation, forced labour and human rights violation from the rest of the mined diamonds. </p>
        <p>Because lab grown diamonds are produced in a laboratory, you can be 100% certain that they do not have a
            damaging impact on our environment and communities. Furthermore, you can get a lab grown diamond more than
            50% larger than a mined diamond at the same price.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="v">
        <h1>are lab grown diamonds <br>certified</h1>
        <p>Yes, lab grown diamonds are independently graded on the exact same criteria by the exact same gemological
            laboratories such as GIA and IGI that also grade mined diamonds. All Sam & J Diamonds are certified Ideal
            Cut, D – F Colour and Flawless – VS2 Clarity grades with no fluorescence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="v1">
        <h1>how are diamonds grown in a lab</h1>
        <p>There are two methods of creating diamonds in a laboratory – High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) and
            Chemical Vapor Depolarisation (CVD).</p>
    </div>


    <div class="t">
        <div class="t1">
            <h1>HPHT</h1>
            <p>A HPHT diamond begins its journey as a small diamond seed placed in a capsule before pure carbon is
                inserted onto the diamond seed. The capsule is then placed into a chamber reactor and surrounded by
                metal anvils. At extreme temperature and pressure, the pure carbon dissolves and its molecules
                crystallise on the diamond seed. Thereafter, it is cooled into the strongest form of carbon – a diamond
                crystal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="t2">
            <h1>CVD</h1>
            <p>A CVD diamond starts as a thin diamond silver placed inside a vacuum plasma reactor. Hydrocarbon gas is
                then injected into the reactor chamber. The CVD process involves breaking down the hydrocarbon gas into
                carbon and hydrogen atoms, which are deposited into the diamond silver to produce a square-shaped
                diamond crystal – the strongest form of carbon.</p>
